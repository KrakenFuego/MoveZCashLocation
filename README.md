Quick and Dirty Powershell script to move the location of the ZCash Blockchain

Just a quick and dirty script I made to move the WinZec wallet location (via symlinking).

It will try to create any folders if they dont exist (if you have used before running the wallet for the first time), or try to move existing folders and then symlink to them.

Unzip, and Run with Powershell (Backup your wallet.dat / keys first just incase)

Disclaimer: There is no warranty of any kind, don't blame me if it goes wrong and fubars your install :)

~~

Enter New Directory in the form G:/Folder

If the whole blockchain already exists (at the time of writing ~10GB, it will take a while to copy obviously)

Known feature – If you run without admin perms - After Script has popped up an admin window it will leave the old window saying Input New Location – Just close it.

If it helped you consider sending me a donation
